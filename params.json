{"name":"Shyhi","tagline":"Location based anonymous messaging application. Get Frisky","body":"### Welcome to ShyHi. Are you ready to get frisky?\r\n\r\nThere's nothing special about what ShyHi is or does. Open up the app and it will figure out where you are, other users around you and set you up to start chatting with another strange soul lost in our trippy world.\r\n\r\nSeriously, that's it. You don't need a profile pic, song, or custom layout. You don't have to login to the 43321st app using facebook or google+ profile. No one needs to or will know who you are(we promise nothing about keeping the strange creatures from outside out solar system or the really smart people in the government out of your business though). Just open it up, type something stupid and hopefully you won't die of boredom.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Want to help develop ShyHi? Easy.
