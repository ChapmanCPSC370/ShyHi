How It Works
============ 

There's nothing special about what ShyHi is or does. Open up the app and it will figure out where you are, 
other users around you and set you up to start chatting with another strange soul lost in our trippy world.

Seriously, that's it. You don't need a profile pic, song, or custom layout. You don't have to login to the
43321st app using facebook or google+ profile. No one needs to or will know who you are(we promise nothing
about keeping the strange creatures from outside out solar system or the really smart people in the government 
out of your business though). Just open it up, type something stupid and hopefuly you won't die of boredom.


Application Infrastructure & Design
===================================

ShyHi trys to keep it simple. We're leveraging other open source software to power this little project of ours. We're running an Ubunutu 14.04 server
hosted on DigitalOcean paid for by the github student pack. Couchbase is powering our server database and functions. We think its a pretty neat bit of
open source software and find that it meets all of our needs. Google Play Services are powering  our location services and we've taken inspiration and 
tips from a number of other open source projects.
